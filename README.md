# 01-Code-Refactor

## Description
A cleaned up version of the Horiseon home page. I looked to follow accessibility standards by adding alt elements to images as well as improve the overal semantic flow of the index.html file. The style.css page had several repititions for selectors and I looked to consolidate that as much as possible while commenting to make sure other web devs can follow the flow of work. This makes the code more manageable and easier to follow if others would like to add their code in the future, but also leaves room for the current engineer to make easy, concise changes.
